# ICARUS PMT Calibration
This repository contains code originally developed by Andrea Scarpelli to perform PMT calibration.

## Calibration procedure

* Take 5 or more runs at different voltages from the nominal (+50 V, +100 V, -50 V, -30 V).
* For each PMT in each run, extract the gain.
* Build the Gain-Voltage curve for each PMT using this 5 points
* Compute the new voltage for the desired nominal gain.

### Available scripts

* hv_files
* make_hist, fit_histo
* gain_equalization
* plotting

## Environment setup
A few instructions on how to setup the code enviroment to run these scripts.

### LArSoft/icaruscode
...

### Python code

Setup a python environment
* Connect to gpvm in the usual way and setup a recent icaruscode version
* Create the environment at a destination of your preference: 
```
python3 -m venv env
```
* do `source env/bin/activate`

* finally `python -m pip install -r requirement.txt

Try then to connect jupyter notebook:
* open tunnel with port forwarding:
```
ssh -K -L 8884:localhost:8884 ascarpel@icarusgpvm05.fnal.gov
```
* Then after activating the enviromnent and inside the disk `icarus/data/` try
```
python -m notebook --no-browser --port=8884
```
and open the browser at the localhost page the notebook is diverting the output to.
If the above command is coupled with `nohup` or launched in a screen session you will keep the process alive even if you log off and when you relogin youâ€™ll just have to create the tunnel again and just go in the browser.
